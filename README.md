Directory Structure and Description

Dataset Description

	-> Dataset [Directory consisting of training images for training]

		-> No Mask
		-> N95 Mask
		-> N95 with Valve Mask
		-> Surgical Mask
		-> Cloth Mask 
		-> dataset.pickel [Consists of Key value pair]

	-> Testing Dataset [Directory consisting of sample images for predictions]

		-> Random



Applied_AI_Project.ipynb 	- Jupyter Notebook which contains entire code for the project

AI Project Report - 1 		- Detailed report about the project 

Expectations-of-Originality 	- Originality form Signed by all the team members

Final_model_trained.pt 		- Trained Model File 

Steps to run the notebook:

The code consists of multiple cells. Functions and classes are declared in Top and training_model is called at very last. Each cell can be executed using Shift + enter and
corresponding outputs are shown at the bottom of the cell. We can also run all the code at once using Restart and Run all in Jupyter notebook and Run all option in Google
colab. The code we created is executed using RTX 3050 processor which is much faster than Google Colab. 

Note : There might be overfitting if we didnt restart the notebook. So it is highly recommended to restart the kernel when training the data everytime.
